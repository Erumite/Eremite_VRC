# Eremite's VRChat Stuff
This repo is here to contain a bunch of VRChat related notes, prefabs and demos.  It serves both as a way of storing notes for myself and for showing friends/fellow creators how I go about certain things.

I'm also trying to address questions people have when starting out by making simple demos that can be referenced; this makes it much easier the second time I get asked the same question. :3

There are various `README.md` files sprinkled around the repo that have more information about the specific folder.  Please refer to them for more detail.

Thanks!
