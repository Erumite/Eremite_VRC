# Eremite's VRChat Stuff
This repo is here to contain a bunch of VRChat related notes, prefabs and demos.  It serves both as a way of storing notes for myself and for showing friends/fellow creators how I go about certain things.

There are various `README.md` files sprinkled around the repo that have more information about the specific folder.  Please refer to them for more detail.

#### How do I download this?
I've started trying to include a `.unitypackage` for most things I've considered finished.  

However, the best way it to click the big green `Clone or Download` button near the top right and download a zip, then grab whatever you need.  To avoid missing dependencies, you might want to just copy the entire `Eremite` folder to `Assets/Eremite`; that way the demo scenes work and anything shared between prefabs doesn't show up as missing.

#### Releases:
Mostly done projects that are in a working state.
* **[Flying Rig](Assets/Eremite/AvatarPrefabs/FlyingRig/)**: Avatar flight controlled by head angle.

* **[Custom Nametag Shader/Rig](Assets/Eremite/Shaders/CustomNametag/)**: Replace your nametag with something fancier. Read the notes well.

#### Utility Assets
* **[VRC Tutorial Man - Optimized](Assets/Eremite/_DemoUtility/VRCMan_Optimized)**: His bones and meshes are a huge mess by default.

#### In-Development
Lots of stuff sprinkled throughout the repo.  Feel free to explore around.  Some of the things may be in various states of broken.

I'm also trying to address questions people have when starting out by making simple demos that can be referenced; this makes it much easier the second time I get asked the same question. :3

* **[Pedestal Unlocks](Assets/Eremite/VRCAPITricks/Pedestal-Unlocks)**: Variety of techniques for triggering things based on putting things on pedestals.
