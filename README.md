# Eremite's VRChat Stuff
This repo is here to contain a bunch of VRChat related notes, prefabs and demos.  It serves both as a way of storing notes for myself and for showing friends/fellow creators how I go about certain things.

There are various `README.md` files sprinkled around the repo that have more information about the specific folder.  Please refer to them for more detail.


#### Releases:
Mostly done projects that are in a working state.

#### In-Development
Lots of stuff sprinkled throughout the repo.  Feel free to explore around.  Some of the things may be in various states of broken.

I'm also trying to address questions people have when starting out by making simple demos that can be referenced; this makes it much easier the second time I get asked the same question. :3

* **[Pedestal Unlocks](Assets/Eremite/VRCAPITricks/Pedestal-Unlocks)**: Variety of techniques for triggering things based on putting things on pedestals.
