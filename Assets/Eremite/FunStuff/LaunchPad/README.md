# Launch Pads
Just a fun unity trick that launches your player when you step off of the launch pad's collider.

This bug got introduced in the 2017 version and persists in 2018.  It may be fixed in future versions though.

Setup:
  Drag `LaunchPad.prefab` into the scene and position it.  You're done.

I also added some wands to spawn some so you can put them wherever you want to launch from. :3  They automatically reap themselves after 10 seconds (adjustable by changing length of the animation).

Could be useful for some puzzle maps or something, maybe.
