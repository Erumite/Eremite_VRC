# Flying Camera Drone
A little flying drone rig that lets you fly around and see through its "eyes."
1. Grab the controller and the camera turns on.
2. Left Click / Controller Trigger moves forward
3. Drone rotation matches controller rotation for steering.
4. Homing Mode Button: Drone will always point toward the controller for retrieval.
5. Night Vision Button: Toggle **[NightVision Shader](Assets/Eremite/Shaders/NightVision)** plane in front of camera to see in the dark.
6. Spotlight Button : Turn on a spotlight pointing forward from the drone.

Pretty much all the broadcasts are local so others won't see what's on the screen by default.

They should be able to see the drone moving around on-screen though since ownership of the drone is taken on controller pickup.

#### Setup:
  Should be pretty much drag and drop.  You'll probably want to replace the demo meshes with something a bit more aesthetically pleasing though. :3
