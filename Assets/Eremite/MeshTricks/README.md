# Mesh Tricks
These are just some useful meshes that I've used in world/avatar creation.  They are either:

* Shapes that unity doesn't provide.
* Lower poly versions of default unity objects.
* Shapes with normals inverted or tweaked to exploit collision or material rendering.

##### List of junk:
* **5-side-cube-trap**: Inverted normal cube with one side deleted.  Useful for trapping things inside it while allowing one side as an exit.
* **sphere_inverted_lowpoly**: A lower-poly version of a sphere with inverted normals.
